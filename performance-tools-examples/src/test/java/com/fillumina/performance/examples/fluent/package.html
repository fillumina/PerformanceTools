        This package contains some examples that are useful to understand how
        to use the library.
        </h1>

        <p>
        It has to be noted that doing accurate performance tests can be very
        time consuming thus these kind of tests cannot be executed as a normal
        unity-tests during development.<br />
        Never the less performances are proper requirements and
        should definitely be part of a specific suite of tests.
        My recommendation is to put
        them in a separate unit and to execute them at every total
        rebuild of the project. Of course this is a sub optimal trade off but
        nobody really wants to wait hours for a performance check at every
        recompilation and at the same time performances should be checked at
        least once in a while.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the present case these examples have been made independent program
        to allow them to be executed individually and to not interfere with
        the normal building process (that requires to execute every test).
