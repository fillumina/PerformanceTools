/**
 * This package contains templates that allow an easy and straightforward
 * construction of performance tests. If you need some
 * customization it is better to use the builders that allows far better
 * control over which classes are executed.
 * Templates are preferred to annotation based framework because there are
 * less things required to remember. Usually the IDE will just create the
 * empty methods ready to be filled in and that's basically all that it's
 * needed.
